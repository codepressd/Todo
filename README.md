## QUICK TODO - PLAYING HOOKY

Made this pretty quick last night but the guts of it seem to work. Not the sexiest thing I've ever built..

### I went with React Hooks

I went with using React Hooks instead of using some type store be it Redux or Mobx. I fealt for such a simple app you would be seeing my skills of writing boilerplate instead of coding. If you would like me to go back and show an implementation with that, no worries.

I went with hooks because its that new hotness and I hadn't had a chance to really play with it.

Also, I'm a fan of functional style programing and there is only one class in this app. Also, this makes it really testable since all the logic is in a few simple functions.

### Commenting

I tried to add comments around the main functions and what they did and also in places where it might not be the best practice but due to the simplicity of this app I thought it would be ok, but explained my reasoning.

Hopefully you like it and I'll be meeting with your team!

Thanks,

Chris


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
